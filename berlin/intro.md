**14–15 October 2026**<br>
**Berlin · Germany**<br>
*Organised and hosted by [PyPSA Labs](https://pypsalabs.org/).*

## Course outline

This two-day workshop introduces [PyPSA](https://docs.pypsa.org/), an
open-source Python package for energy system modelling and energy infrastructure
planning. It also explores [PyPSA-Eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/), a
European energy system model and data pipeline maintained at TU Berlin.


### What you will learn

- **PyPSA fundamentals:** Data structures and fundamental components,
	formulation of optimisation problems, results retrieval and visualisation
- **Capacity expansion:**  Capacity planning problems with PyPSA
- **Stochastic and risk-averse optimisation:** Handling uncertainty and risk management in energy system models
- **Sector coupling:** Multi-carrier networks and energy conversion
- **Other features:** Custom constraints, the statistics module, network explorer.
- **PyPSA-Eur:** A tour through to the European energy system model workflow and data pipeline

Some familiarity with Python and `pandas` is helpful, but not required. Short introductions to both are included in the annexes.

## Lecturers

[Dr. Fabian Neumann](https://fneum.org) and [Dr. Iegor Riepin](https://iriepin.com/) are postdoctoral researchers at the
[Department of Digital Transformation in Energy Systems](https://www.tu.berlin/en/ensys)
at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en). Their research work focuses on identifying cost-effective pathways to climate neutrality, leveraging energy modelling to inform policy and public discourse.

Fabian and Iegor are also co-founders
of [PyPSA Labs](https://pypsalabs.org/).



## Technical setup

### Workshop JupyterHub (recommended)

Run everything in your browser with all packages pre-installed, on the workshop JupyterHub:

1. Open [workshop.pypsalabs.org](https://workshop.pypsalabs.org).
2. Log in with any username you like and the **workshop password** shown by the presenter.
3. The workshop notebooks are already in your workspace. Open `01-pypsa-intro.ipynb` to begin.

Your files are saved between the two workshop days. Use the same username on both days.

### Google Colab (fallback)

No hub access? You can also run the notebooks in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): on any notebook page, click **🚀 Open this notebook in Google Colab** (a Google account is required). On Colab you install the packages yourself, as noted at the top of each notebook.

### Local installation

If you prefer to run the notebooks on your own computer, follow the instructions on the next page. You will need to install `pixi`, which sets up Python and all required packages for you.
