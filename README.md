# PyPSA Workshop Berlin (October 2026)

Materials for a hands-on energy system modelling workshop in Berlin, organised
and hosted by [PyPSA Labs](https://pypsalabs.org/). See the
[workshop listing and agenda](https://pypsalabs.org/services/training).

The materials are published as a [Jupyter Book 2](https://jupyterbook.org)
(MyST) website at
[pypsalabs.github.io/workshop-202610](https://pypsalabs.github.io/workshop-202610/).

## Usage

### Develop locally

Install [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh), clone the repository, and run:

```sh
pixi install
pixi run jupyter book start
```

This serves a local live preview. Workshop sources are in `berlin/`. To execute all notebooks and create the deployable site in
`_build/html/`, run:

```sh
pixi run jupyter-book build --html --execute
```

### Environments and deployment

Dependencies are declared in `pixi.toml` (conda-forge). Reproducible
installations use `pixi.lock` with `pixi install` (run `pixi update` to refresh
it).

Pushes to `main` build and deploy the website through GitHub Actions. A separate
workflow (`.github/workflows/notebook-image.yml`) builds the single-user
notebook image for the workshop JupyterHub from the pixi `image` environment and
pushes it to GHCR. Lockfiles are generated locally and committed when
dependencies change. Participant-facing installation instructions are in
`berlin/setup.md`.

## Credits

Some of the workshop materials are adapted from Fabian Neumann's fantastic
[Data Science for Energy System Modelling](https://fneum.github.io/data-science-for-esm/)
course at TU Berlin.

The workshop also draws on examples and explanations from the
[PyPSA documentation](https://docs.pypsa.org/).

This workshop is created using the open-source
[Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/).
